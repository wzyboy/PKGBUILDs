# How to send "pull requests"
AUR now uses a new package management system, which is git-based itself. So there is no need to use third-party git repo like GitHub any longer. There is currently no way to send a GitHub-style "pull request" to package maintainers in the new version of AUR. If you would like to suggest some changes, you are always welcome to send me an old-style email patch: simply clone the repo from AUR, make some changes, commit your work and use `git-format-patch(1)` to send me a patch!
